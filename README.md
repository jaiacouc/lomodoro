## General Information

- This app allows users to use a pomodoro timer with the option to play lofi music and manage tasks with a todo list.
- This web app is hosted in google firebase.
- This app connects to a api I created [_here_](https://github.com/jaiacouc/LoFiApi) to play the lofi music, the app was created with Reactjs using react hooks throughout. It uses bootstrap components for some components of the app and other parts are regular HTML/CSS.
- I created this app because I found myself listening to tons of lofi music and also using a pomodoro timer when working on school work or coding. I decided to code my own web app for more practice with React.
